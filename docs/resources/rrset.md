# poweradmin_rrset (Resource)

Manages a DNS Resource Record Set (RRSet). An RRSet is a collection of records with the same name and type, managed as a single unit. This matches PowerDNS behavior and is the DNS-correct way to handle multiple records.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an RRSet with multiple A records (load balancing)
resource "poweradmin_rrset" "web_servers" {
  zone_id = poweradmin_zone.example_com.id
  name    = "www"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = 300

  records = [
    {
      content  = "192.0.2.10"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
    {
      content  = "192.0.2.11"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
    {
      content  = "192.0.2.12"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
  ]
}

# Create an RRSet with MX records (with priorities)
resource "poweradmin_rrset" "mail_servers" {
  zone_id = poweradmin_zone.example_com.id
  name    = "@"
  type    = "MX"
  ttl     = 3600

  records = [
    {
      content  = "mail1.example.com"
      priority = 10
      disabled = false
    },
    {
      content  = "mail2.example.com"
      priority = 20
      disabled = false
    },
  ]
}

# Create an RRSet with AAAA records (IPv6)
resource "poweradmin_rrset" "ipv6" {
  zone_id = poweradmin_zone.example_com.id
  name    = "www"
  type    = "AAAA"
  ttl     = 3600

  records = [
    {
      content  = "2001:db8::1"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
    {
      content  = "2001:db8::2"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
  ]
}

# Create an RRSet with TXT record
resource "poweradmin_rrset" "spf" {
  zone_id = poweradmin_zone.example_com.id
  name    = "@"
  type    = "TXT"
  ttl     = 3600

  records = [
    {
      content  = "v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
  ]
}

# Create an RRSet with NS records (subdomain delegation)
resource "poweradmin_rrset" "subdomain_ns" {
  zone_id = poweradmin_zone.example_com.id
  name    = "subdomain"
  type    = "NS"
  ttl     = 86400

  records = [
    {
      content  = "ns1.subdomain-provider.example"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
    {
      content  = "ns2.subdomain-provider.example"
      disabled = false
      priority = 0
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Record name (use @ for zone apex, or subdomain like 'www')
- `records` (Attributes Set) Set of record contents. All records in the RRSet share the same name, type, and TTL. Order is not significant. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--records))
- `type` (String) Record type (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc.)
- `zone_id` (Number) Zone ID where the RRSet will be created

### Optional

- `ttl` (Number) Time to live (TTL) in seconds. Defaults to 3600.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) RRSet identifier (format: zone_id/name/type)

<a id="nestedatt--records"></a>
### Nested Schema for `records`

Required:

- `content` (String) Record content (IP address, hostname, text, etc.)

Optional:

- `disabled` (Boolean) Whether this record is disabled. Default: false
- `priority` (Number) Priority for MX, SRV and other priority-bearing records. Default: 0
